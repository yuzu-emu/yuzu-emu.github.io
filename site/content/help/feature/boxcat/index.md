Boxcat is an open-source replacement for Nintendo's BCAT service. BCAT is a network games can leverage to add dynamic content to games. Some examples of features games make use of this for are splatoon 2 splatfests, splatoon 2 course rotations, super mario odyssey costumes, super smash bros. ultimate news, and even the news feed on the home menu. By emulating the BCAT service at a high-level, yuzu is able to intercept the game's calls to Nintendo's servers and reroute them to yuzu's servers.
