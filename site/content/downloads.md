The nightly build of yuzu contains already reviewed and tested features. If you require support with the installation or use of yuzu, or you want to report bugs you should use this version.
This version is still in development, so expect crashes and bugs.
Linux builds require Ubuntu 18.04 or above, otherwise building it yourself is highly recommended.
The canary build of yuzu is the same as our nightly builds, with additional features that are still waiting on review before making it into the official yuzu builds.

If you believe you've found a bug, please retest on our nightly builds.
This version is still in development, so expect crashes and bugs.
