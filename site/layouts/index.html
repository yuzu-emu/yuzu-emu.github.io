                    yuzu is a work-in-progress Nintendo Switch emulator. yuzu is an open-source project, licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later
                    version). yuzu has been designed with portability in mind, with builds available for Windows, Linux,
                    and macOS. The project was started in spring of 2017 by bunnei, one of the original authors of the popular
                    Citra 3DS emulator, to experiment with and research the Nintendo Switch. Due to the similarities between
                    Switch and 3DS, yuzu was developed as a fork of Citra. This means that it uses the same project architecture,
                    and both emulators benefit from shared improvements. During the early months of development, work was
                    done in private, and progress was slow. However, as Switch reverse-engineering and homebrew development
                    became popular, work on yuzu began to take off as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In January of 2018, the yuzu team was formed out of several Citra developers, and the decision was made to release the project
                    publicly. As an emulator, yuzu is in its infancy, and is only currently useful for Switch reverse-engineering
                    and homebrew development.

                                No – at this time, yuzu does not run any commercial Switch games. yuzu can boot some games, to varying degrees of success,
                                but does not implement any of the necessary GPU features to render 3D graphics.

                                In short – we do not know how soon games might run. While yuzu is making great progress, Switch emulation is very complex.
                                Running games is one of the team’s top priorities, so we are actively working toward that
                                goal!

                                an homage to Citra and its developers, whose work gave the foundation for this project.
