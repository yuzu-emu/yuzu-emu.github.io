      <description>yuzu emulator yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of Citra.
It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS. The emulator is currently only useful for homebrew development and research purposes.
yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore is generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew applications. At this time, yuzu does not run any commercial Switch games.</description>

      <description> A very incomplete overview of useful information to get started with Switch development. Please add anything that&amp;rsquo;s missing :)
Switch Hardware/Software  ReSwitched an excellent resource and community for Switch homebrew and hacking. SwitchBrew is probably the best resource for the Switch hardware/software internals. ARMv8-A Reference Manual describes Switch&amp;rsquo;s CPU architecture.  </description>

      <description>Welcome to the fun and exciting world of Switch homebrew! Things here are brand new and highly technical, so we highly recommend that you don&amp;rsquo;t proceed unless you&amp;rsquo;d like to get your hands dirty. If so, here are the best resources for getting started:  LibTransistor, the homebrew library from the ReSwitched team. LibNx, the homebrew library from the SwitchBrew team.  Available homebrew demos:

      <description>Developing an emulator for a modern, complex system like the Nintendo Switch requires significant hard work and dedication from a large team of developers. We will never charge you for yuzu and will always make our source code freely available. We do not make any money from our work, however development has many expenses that are often paid out-of-pocket by our team members, among them
 Switch consoles to explore and reverse-engineer the hardware Switch games for testing, reverse-engineering, and implementing new features Web hosting and infrastructure setup Software licenses (e.</description>

      <description>The nightly build of yuzu contains already reviewed and tested features. If you require support with the installation or use of yuzu, or you want to report bugs you should use this version. This version is still in development, so expect crashes and bugs.
The canary build of yuzu is the same as our nightly builds, with additional features that are still waiting on review before making it into the official yuzu builds.</description>
